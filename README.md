# Installation
before installation make sure you use your maxmind license key
```
export MAXMIND_LICENSE_KEY=DcKHcgwnPJzs2zonifsfdddf
npm install
npm start
```
The default listening port is 2323, but can be changed with env variable TELNET_PORT.
If you also need it on a privileged port like port 23 you may want to use iptables redirection.
```
sudo iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -p tcp --dport 23 -j REDIRECT --to-port 2323
```
